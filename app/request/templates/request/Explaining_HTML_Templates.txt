The way templates work is you extend into the page you want by {% extends 'appName/TemplateYouWantToLoad.html' %}

django will search the templates folder of every app, go into the app you call, and inject whatever you are coding
into the template you called.

To inject code, look at the template you want to inject into and find the {% block NameOfBlock %}
In the template you are creating, make the same {% block NameOfBlock %} and end it with {% endblock NameOfBlock %}
inside the block, add the html elements you want to appear, you can pass in objects to render, but that will require changing the
views.py and passing an extra argument in. 
I do this in the def viewRides in this views.py. I create a dictionary based of the database output, and pass it in as a third arguement
